/**
 * Java program to sort integer array using bubble sort sorting algorithm.
 * bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithm but performance
 * of bubble sort is not good, its average and worst case performance
 * ranges in O(n2) and that's why it is not used to sort large set of
 * unsorted data. Bubble sort can be used for educational and testing
 * purpose to sort small number of data to avoid performance penalty. 
 * This program is also a good example of how to print contents of Array in Java
